# Task 1: Logic for extracting join conditions from the WHERE clause

1. Parsing WHERE clause: When you build a query plan, first parse the WHERE clause in a query. This is achieved by using the `JSQLParser` library, which parses SQL statements and extracts the various components, including the expressions in the WHERE clause.

2. To handle conditions in the WHERE clause, I use the `JoinExpressionDeParser` class. The purpose of this class is to iterate over all the expressions in the WHERE clause and identify which are join conditions based on the tables and columns involved in those expressions.

3. Once connection conditions are identified, they are collected and used in subsequent connection operations. This means that when you build join operators (such as JoinOperator), these join conditions extracted from the WHERE clause will directly affect how the two tables are joined. Doing so ensures that only rows that meet certain criteria are joined, reducing the size of the intermediate result set generated by the join operation.

# Task 2: How to optimize the query plan

1. Selection Push down. This query plan push down the selection operation before join, which can reduce the amount of data process and the size of the intermediate result set generated by the join operation.

2. Projection Push down. This query plan push down the projection operation before order by, which can reduce the amount of data process and the size of the intermediate result set generated by the order by operation.
